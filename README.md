# Compound Interest Calculator

### This project was created as part of an IBM Cloud Computing course that I took. One of the requirements was to create and deploy a simple interest calculator to the IBM cloud. There were specific styling requirements necessary to submit this project and complete the course, but I have since gone back to add the money background image, and change the calculator from one that computes simple interest, to one that computes compound interest.

### This project was created with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
